Your project is now configured for deployment to Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend).

## What's Been Configured

### Backend (Render)
- âœ… Updated `package.json` with Node.js version and proper metadata
- âœ… Created `render.yaml` for service configuration
- âœ… Updated CORS settings for production
- âœ… Created environment variable templates
- âœ… Production-ready server configuration

### Frontend (Vercel)
- âœ… Updated API service to handle different environments
- âœ… Created `vercel.json` for deployment configuration
- âœ… Added environment variable templates
- âœ… Configured for SPA routing

### Additional Files Created
- ðŸ“„ `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Detailed step-by-step deployment instructions
- ðŸ“„ `setup-deployment.js` - Helper script for environment setup
- ðŸ“„ `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - CI/CD workflow (optional)
- ðŸ“„ Environment templates for both frontend and backend

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Backend on Render
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Create a new Web Service on Render
3. Connect your GitHub repo
4. Set root directory to `backend`
5. Add environment variables from `.env.production`
6. Deploy!

### 2. Frontend on Vercel
1. Create a new project on Vercel
2. Import your GitHub repo
3. Set root directory to `frontend`
4. Add environment variable: `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
5. Deploy!

### 3. Connect Them
1. Update backend's `CORS_ORIGIN` with your Vercel URL
2. Update frontend's `VITE_API_BASE_URL` with your Render URL

## Important URLs to Update

After deployment, you'll need to update these:

**In Render (Backend):**
```
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-project.vercel.app
```

**In Vercel (Frontend):**
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com/api
```
